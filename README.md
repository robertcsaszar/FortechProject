# Project Management Tool

Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to harness the power of pure / vanilla JavaScript in order to build a project management tool that will track all the work made by your team. A visual interface (UI) is optional but it's recommended. Focus on working with functions and objects first.

Below youâ€™ll find the requirements for the application and a breakdown of the fields to be used.

You shall deliver the code for this application and picture/s for the diagrams that illustrate your understanding of the application logic.

The application will handle a single project (at this step), but that project has more than 1 versions/milestones (called sprints).
A user can create 3 types of issues for a project: features, bugs, and tasks. Each of these issues belongs to a certain sprint inside the project. Features and bugs can have multiple tasks (called subtasks), which are basically the breakdown of the bigger issues - features and bugs.

Each issue has multiple possible states ( status ), which are described below:
* New
* In progress
* Feedback
* Rework
* Resolved
* Ready for Testing


Checkout the breakdown of fields for each big component of the project.

| User | #
| ------ | :----:|
| **id** | numeric - unique |
| **name** | text|

| Issue | #
| ------ | :----: |
| **id** | numeric - unique |
| **type** | string |
| **name** | text|
| **sprint** | sprint.id |
| **createdBy** | user.id |
| **assignee** | user.id |
| **description** | text |
| **status** | status.id |
| **tasks** | issue.ids |
| **comments** | comment.ids |
| **updatedAt** | date |
| **createdAt** | date |

| Project | #
| ------ | :----:|
| **id** | numeric - unique |
| **sprints** | sprint.ids |

| Sprint | #

| **id** | numeric - unique |
| **name** | text |

| Comments | #

| **id** | numeric - unique |
| **name** | text |


**The ID is generated when the issue is created, is unique and cannot be changed.**

**CreatedBy will be filled on creation with the ID of the user that created that issue**

**The fields UpdatedAt and CreatedAt are updated automatically on issue creation or change.**

**Only issues of type BUG or FEATURE can have subtasks.**


### Functionality needed:

A user needs to be able to create any kind of issue with some initial values. All newly created issues will have the status __New__.

The user needs to see an overview of the current project, broken down per sprints, how many issues in each status, how many features, how many bugs, etc.

Apart for the fields mentioned above, the user can change any field of an issue through an __UPDATE__ action.

If the user moves the bug or feature in a different sprint, the subtasks will have to be moved as well.

Completing all the tasks of a __bug__ or __feature__ will change the status of that issue to Ready For Testing.

As soon as a task changes its status from __New__ to any other, it's corresponding issue will change it's status as well to it's parent status.

A user can create sprints to which the issues will be assigned.

A user can filter the issues by sprint or status.

### Requirements

You have **1 day** from the moment you receive the problem to ask any relevant question about the specifications.
You have **3 days** to submit your code that implements the above mentioned functionalities.
The code should be added to a **public git repository**, we strongly recomment github for this.

 **We will take into consideration your coding style and your code organization and structure as well as the correctness of the provided solution.**
